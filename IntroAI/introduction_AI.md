> The science of making machines?

Four main approaches:

| **Thinking Humanly** 	| **Thinking Rationally** 	|
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:	|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:	|
| "The exciting new effort to make computers think ... _machines with minds_,  in the full and literal sense"(Haugeland, 1985) 	| "The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason and act."(Winston, 1992) 	|
| **Acting Humanly** 	| **Acting Rationally** 	|
| "The study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better."(Rich and Knight, 1991) 	| "AI...is concerned with intelligent behavior in artifacts."(Nilsson, 1998) 	|

#### Acting humanly: The Turing test approach

Turing test (Alan Turing, 1950) --> _Imitation Game:_ can a human interrogator tell the difference between human's or computer's response?.

Intelligent systems would need the following capabilities:
* Natural language processing
* Knowledge representation
* Automated reasoning
* Machine learning
