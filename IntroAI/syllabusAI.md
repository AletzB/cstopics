# Artificial Intelligence

## Course description
Although Artificial Intelligence has several interpretations around academics, we are focus on the study and development of rational agents. In a very specific and technical way, a rational agent must act in order to maximize the expected utility. Therefore, the goal of this course is to study and put in practice the theory and methods to build rational agents, able to interact in different conditions and tasks.
