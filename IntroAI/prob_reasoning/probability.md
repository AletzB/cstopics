- **Diagnosis:** physician measuring all kind of symptoms in a patient. Infer posterior distribution over the possible diseases causing those symptoms.
- **Speech recognition:** from noise signal, infer the word that was pronounce
- **Tracking objects:** infer orientation an position of a rocket with some measurements.

## Uncertainty
### General situation
- **Observed variables (evidence):** the agent knows certain things about the state of the world.
- **Unobserved variables:** the agent needs to reason about other aspects.
- **Model:** the agent can build a model that relates his knowledge about the known variables with the unknown ones.

### Probabilistic reasoning gives us a framework for managing our beliefs and knowledge
