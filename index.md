# Computer Science

This site offers you the theoretical concepts and practical examples to start involving you in the world of computer science. We will cover basic topics for different programming languages and useful concepts and tools for managing operating systems. Then, we will introduce you to the field of Artificial Intelligence, in which we will learn how to design and program intelligent agents for several tasks. Also, there would be some artificial vision methods to give the agent the possibility to interpret its world through image acquisition.
