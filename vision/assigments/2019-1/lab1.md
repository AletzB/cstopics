# Lab 2

Having the following image (right-click and save image...):

<div class="picture">
  <img style="width:100%;" src ="/cstopics/assets/notebooks/vision_notebooks/images/00_photo2.jpeg" />
</div>

Process it in the spatial domain (manually), to get an image as close as you can to the following:

<div class="picture">
  <img style="width:100%;" src ="/cstopics/assets/notebooks/vision_notebooks/images/00_photo1.jpeg" />
</div>

Create a python program that counts colored balls simultaneously, between red, blue and green, on a white platform. When the script starts, you must "teach" it the three colors to read, placing some balls of the same color on the platform, and pressing ***R***, ***G*** or ***B*** key correspondly. Once the three colors are learned, the program starts counting the balls it sees passing from right to left.

Create a new **private** Bitbucket repository named *"2018_2_av_lab2_Lastname1Firstname1_Lastname2Firstname2"* (E.g. *"2018_2_av_lab2_CamachoCamilo_SuarezYeison"*),  share it with the account *"camilocamachousta"*. Inside it  add all your lab files.

When the homework is ready, download the repository as a *.zip* file and upload it to the appropriate link in moodle.
