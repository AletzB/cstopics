- Description of project
  - Theoretical foundations for the solution
  - Block and/or flow diagram
  - Technical specifications of the implemented technique (E.g. architecture of networks, CSP formulation, parameters for RL, methods and deep for adversarial search, structures of filters)
  - Photos or screenshots of your project
  - Link to your project's YouTube video
- Dependencies and instructions to run the Project
- Resources (your bibliography)

The name of the repository must follow the format: *20182_cstopics_nameOfProject*

- One slide to explain the theoretical foundations for the solution.
- One slide that presents the block and/or flow diagram.
- One slide that describes the technical specifications of the implemented technique.

- Include the link to your repository.

For example:

```
Project name: Pacman solution via Dijkstra algorithm
Members: Homer Simpson and Moe Szyslak
Main technique used: Dijkstra algorithm

This project was developed in the Universidad Santo Tom치s, in Bogot치 Colombia.
In the following courses:
    * Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
        (https://cstopics.github.io/cstopics/artificial-intelligence/syllabusAI)
    * Artificial Vision
        (https://cstopics.github.io/cstopics/vision)

Source code:

```

## Socialization
Each group must socialize the project to their partners and teachers on 21st November.

The groups have 10 minutes, using their own Readme, to show the development and working of the project.
