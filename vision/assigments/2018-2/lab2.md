# Lab 1

Create a python program that counts colored balls simultaneously, between red, blue and green, on a white platform. When the script starts, you must "teach" it the three colors to read, placing some balls of the same color on the platform, and pressing ***R***, ***G*** or ***B*** key correspondly. Once the three colors are learned, the program starts counting the balls it sees passing from right to left.

Create a new **private** Bitbucket repository named *"2018_2_av_lab2_Lastname1Firstname1_Lastname2Firstname2"* (E.g. *"2018_2_av_lab2_CamachoCamilo_SuarezYeison"*),  share it with the account *"camilocamachousta"*. Inside it  add all your lab files.

When the homework is ready, download the repository as a *.zip* file and upload it to the appropriate link in moodle.

Deadline: Sep 7, 23:55
