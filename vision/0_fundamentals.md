# Digital Image Fundamentals

## Elements of Visual Perception

### Structure of the Human Eye

<span style="color:red">Human Eye Image</span>

* The **Cornea** is a tough, transparent tissue that covers the anterior surface of the eye.
* The **Sclera** is an opaque membrane that encloses the remainder of the optic globe.
* The **Choroid** contrarians the blood vessels, which are the major source of nutrition to the eye.
* The **lens** is made up of concentric layer of fibers cells and is supported by fibers that attach to the ciliary body.
* The **Retina** lines the inside of the wallâ€™s entire posterior portion. Its surface include two classes of light receptors: cones and rods.
* The **cones** lies on the fovea and highly sensitive to color (6-7 million in each eye). They solve fine details because each one them is connected to its own nerve end.
* The **rods** (75-150 million), which are distributed over the retinal surface and serves to give general overall picture of the field of view and are sensitive to low level illumination. Are connected to a unique nerve.

The following image shows the density of rods and cones for a cross section of the right eye passing through the region of emergence of the optic nerve from the eye.
