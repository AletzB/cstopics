## Homework 3

Parallelize the [Homework 2](/cstopics/programming/operating-systems/assigments/hw2) program with processes, as in the [Class example](https://github.com/cstopics/cstopics/blob/gh-pages/assets/code/os/pi_n_processes.cpp){:target="blank"}. The programs must receive as arguments the number iterations and the number of processes to be launched.

Create a new **private** Bitbucket repository named *"2018_2_d3_hw3_LastnameFirstname"* (E.g. *"2018_2_d3_hw3_CamachoCamilo"*), share it with the account *"camilocamachousta"*, and add the files below:

* *pi_montecarlo_processes.cpp* with the *c++* code.
* A *Makefile* with the rules *all*, *pi_montecarlo_processes* and *clean*. (Refer to the [C/C++ in Linux](/cstopics/programming/c-c++/c_c++_in_linux) guide)

When the repository is ready, download it as a *.zip* file and upload it to the appropriate link in moodle.

Deadline: Aug 30
