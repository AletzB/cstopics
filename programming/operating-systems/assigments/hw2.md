* *pi_montecarlo.cpp* with the *c++* code.
* A *Makefile* with the rules *all*, *pi_montacarlo* and *clean*. (Refer to the [C/C++ in Linux](/cstopics/programming/c-c++/c_c++_in_linux) guide)

When the repository is ready, download it as a *.zip* file and upload it to the appropriate link in moodle.
