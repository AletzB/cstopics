## Homework 4

Replicate the example of the Producer-Consumer Schema studied in the [IPC Section](/cstopics/programming/operating-systems/3_processes/3_2_communication) ([Code TX](https://github.com/cstopics/cstopics/blob/gh-pages/assets/code/os/queue_producer.cpp){:target="blank"} and [Code RX](https://github.com/cstopics/cstopics/blob/gh-pages/assets/code/os/queue_consumer.cpp){:target="blank"}, but transmitting character strings entered by the user, instead of random integers.

Create a new **private** Bitbucket repository named *"2018_2_d3_hw4_LastnameFirstname"* (E.g. *"2018_2_d3_hw4_CamachoCamilo"*), share it with the account *"camilocamachousta"*, and add the files below:

* *tx.cpp* with the *c++* code for the producer.
* *rx.cpp* with the *c++* code for the consumer.
* A *Makefile* with the rules *all*, *tx*, *rx* and *clean*. (Refer to the [C/C++ in Linux](/cstopics/programming/c-c++/c_c++_in_linux) guide)

When the repository is ready, download it as a *.zip* file and upload it to the appropriate link in moodle.

Deadline: Sep 6
