## Homework 5

Create a non-blocking chat in Qt, where the GUI never blocks waiting for messages.

Requirements:

* The clients (A and B) can send any number of messages.
* A and B must be different processes.
* Each client must show its own messages, and the ones it receives.

Create a new **private** Bitbucket repository named *"2018_2_d3_hw5_LastnameFirstname"* (E.g. *"2018_2_d3_hw5_CamachoCamilo"*), share it with the account *"camilocamachousta"*, and add the files below:

* Two Qt project folders.

When the repository is ready, download it as a *.zip* file and upload it to the appropriate link in moodle.

Deadline: Sep 27
