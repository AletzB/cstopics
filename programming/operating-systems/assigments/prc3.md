## Practice 3

Write a C/C++ program, using the Qt api and gui tools, to play "***triqui***".

Requirements:

* The user can enter the name of the two players before start playing.
* The game must be performed 5 times.
* The program must choose randomly the player that starts.
* Two names must be shown in the window, but the name of the current player must be highlighted.
* Current scores (times each player has won) must be shown all the time.
* At the end, the name and score of the winner must be shown.
* Must exist a button to restart the game (in any moment), asking for the players' names again.

Create a new **private** Bitbucket repository named *"2018_2_d3_prc3_LastnameFirstname"* (E.g. *"2018_2_d3_prc3_CamachoCamilo"*), share it with the account *"camilocamachousta"*, and add homework files.

When the repository is ready, download it as a *.zip* file and upload it to the appropriate link in moodle.

Deadline: Sep 13
