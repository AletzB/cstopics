Write a *C/C++* program that reads a text file (*hw1.txt*), and generates a new file (*HW1.txt*) with the same content but is capital letters.

Create a new **private** Bitbucket repository named *"2018_2_d3_hw1_lastname_firstname"* (E.g. *"2018_2_d3_hw1_camacho_camilo"*),  share it with the account *"camilocamachousta"*, and add the files below:

* *pseudo.txt*: pseudocode with the system calls.
* *hw1.c* or *hw1.cpp* with the *c/c++* code.
* An *hw1.txt* sample file.
* A *Makefile* with the rules *compile* and *run*. (Refer to the [C/C++ in Linux](/cstopics/programming/c-c++/c_c++_in_linux) guide)

When the repository is ready, download it as a *.zip* file and upload it to the appropriate link in moodle.

## Homework 2

Write a C/C++ programs that calculates the &pi; constant using the Monte Carlo Method method. The number of iterations must be provided via the first command line argument, and show the result on the terminal.

Create a new **private** Bitbucket repository named *"2018_2_d3_hw2_LastnameFirstname"* (E.g. *"2018_2_d3_hw2_CamachoCamilo"*),  share it with the account *"camilocamachousta"*, and add the files below:

* *pi_montecarlo.cpp* with the *c++* code.
* A *Makefile* with the rules *all*, *pi_montacarlo* and *clean*. (Refer to the [C/C++ in Linux](/cstopics/programming/c-c++/c_c++_in_linux) guide)

When the repository is ready, download it as a *.zip* file and upload it to the appropriate link in moodle.
